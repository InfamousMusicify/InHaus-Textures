__All of my projects take an inordinant amount of time to upkeep/create.  
I use my free time to make them.  Any support would be much appreciated!  
If you enjoy these packs and want to see more like them and see them maintained, [send me some love](https://www.patreon.com/InfamousMusicify)!__  

If you're here I assume you've got one or more of the packs,  
Thanks for checking them out!  

Cheers
